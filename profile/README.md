### GitHub Theme Compatibility

To ensure optimal visibility in both light and dark modes:
- Use **contrast-friendly badge colors** (`logoColor=white`)
- Avoid light icons on light backgrounds
- Use vector logos (like [shields.io](https://shields.io) and [skillicons.dev](https://skillicons.dev)) for crisp rendering
